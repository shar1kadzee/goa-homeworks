                <h1>Mental disorder</h1>
                <p class="p-1">A mental disorder, also referred to as a mental illness,[6] a mental health condition,[7]
                    or a
                    psychiatric
                    disability,[2] is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of
                    personal
                    functioning.[8] A mental disorder is also characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in
                    an
                    individual's cognition, emotional regulation, or behavior, often in a social context.[9][10] Such
                    disturbances may occur as single episodes, may be persistent, or may be relapsingâ€“remitting. There
                    are
                    many
                    different types of mental disorders, with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific
                    disorders.[10][11] A mental disorder is one aspect of mental health.</p>

                <p class="p-2">
                    The causes of mental disorders are often unclear. Theories incorporate findings from a range of
                    fields.
                    Disorders may be associated with particular regions or functions of the brain. Disorders are usually
                    diagnosed or assessed by a mental health professional, such as a clinical psychologist,
                    psychiatrist,
                    psychiatric nurse, or clinical social worker, using various methods such as psychometric tests, but
                    often
                    relying on observation and questioning. Cultural and religious beliefs, as well as social norms,
                    should
                    be
                    taken into account when making a diagnosis.[12]

                    Services for mental disorders are usually based in psychiatric hospitals, outpatient clinics, or in
                    the
                    community, Treatments are provided by mental health professionals. Common treatment options are
                    psychotherapy or psychiatric medication, while lifestyle changes, social interventions, peer
                    support,
                    and
                    self-help are also options. In a minority of cases, there may be involuntary detention or treatment.

                <p class="p-3">In 2019, common mental disorders around the globe include: depression, which affects
                    about 264
                    million people; dementia, which affects about 50 million; bipolar disorder, which affects about
                    45
                    million; and schizophrenia and other psychoses, which affect about 20 million people.[10]
                    Neurodevelopmental disorders include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism
                    spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability, of which onset occurs early in the
                    developmental period.[14][10] Stigma and discrimination can add to the suffering and disability
                    associated with mental disorders, leading to various social movements attempting to increase
                    understanding and challenge social exclusion.</p>
