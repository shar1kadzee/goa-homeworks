                <p style="background-color: burlywood;">The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera,
                    native to Africa and India. It has a
                    muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip
                    of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent
                    mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult
                    males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on
                    medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions
                    scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not
                    actively seek out and prey on humans.</p>
