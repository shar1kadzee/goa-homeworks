                <h1>J. R. R. Tolkien</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="p-1">John Ronald Reuel Tolkien CBE FRSL (/ˈruːl ˈtɒlkiːn/,[a] 3 January 1892 – 2 September
                    1973) was an
                    English writer and philologist. He was the author of the high fantasy works The Hobbit and The Lord
                    of the Rings.

                    From 1925 to 1945, Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow of
                    Pembroke College, both at the University of Oxford. He then moved within the same university to
                    become the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, and
                    held these positions from 1945 until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien was a close friend of C. S.
                    Lewis, a co-member of the informal literary discussion group The Inklings. He was appointed a
                    Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.</p>

                <p class="p-2">After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his
                    father's
                    extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The
                    Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories,
                    invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and, within it,
                    Middle-earth. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of
                    these writings.

                    While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the tremendous success of
                    The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings ignited a profound interest in the fantasy genre and ultimately
                    precipitated an avalanche of new fantasy books and authors. As a result, he has been popularly
                    identified as the "father" of modern fantasy literature and is widely regarded as one of the most
                    influential authors of all time.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="p-3 ">Tolkien was English, and thought of himself as such.[3][T 1] His immediate paternal
                    ancestors were
                    middle-class craftsmen who made and sold clocks, watches and pianos in London and Birmingham. The
                    Tolkien family originated in the East Prussian town of Kreuzburg near Königsberg, which had been
                    founded during the medieval German eastward expansion, where his earliest-known paternal ancestor,
                    Michel Tolkien, was born around 1620.[4]

                    Michel's son Christianus Tolkien (1663–1746) was a wealthy miller in Kreuzburg.[4] His son,
                    Christian Tolkien (1706–1791), moved from Kreuzburg to nearby Danzig, and his two sons Daniel
                    Gottlieb Tolkien (1747–1813) and Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien (1752–1819) emigrated
                    to London in the 1770s and became the ancestors of the English family; the younger brother was J. R.
                    R. Tolkien's second great-grandfather.[4]

                    In 1792, John Benjamin Tolkien and William Gravell took over the Erdley Norton manufacture in
                    London, which from then on sold clocks and watches under the name Gravell & Tolkien. Daniel Gottlieb
                    obtained British citizenship in 1794, but John Benjamin apparently never became a British citizen.
                    Other German relatives joined the two brothers in London. Several people with the surname Tolkien or
                    similar spelling, some of them members of the same family as J. R. R. Tolkien, live in northern
                    Germany, but most of them are descendants of people who evacuated East Prussia in 1945, at the end
                    of World War II.</p>

                <p class="p-4">According to Ryszard Derdziński, the surname Tolkien is of Low Prussian origin and
                    probably means
                    "son/descendant of Tolk".[5][4] Tolkien mistakenly believed his surname derived from the German word
                    tollkühn, meaning "foolhardy",[7] and jokingly inserted himself as a "cameo" into The Notion Club
                    Papers under the literally translated name Rashbold.[8] However, Derdziński has demonstrated this to
                    be a false etymology. While J. R. R. Tolkien was aware of his family's German origin, his knowledge
                    of the family's history was limited because he was "early isolated from the family of his
                    prematurely deceased father"</p>
