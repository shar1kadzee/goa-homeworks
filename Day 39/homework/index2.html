    <p>Reptiles, as commonly defined, are a group of tetrapods with an ectothermic ('cold-blooded') metabolism and
        amniotic development. Living traditional reptiles comprise four orders: Testudines (turtles), Crocodilia
        (crocodilians), Squamata (lizards and snakes), and Rhynchocephalia (the tuatara). As of May 2023, about 12,000
        living species of reptiles are listed in the Reptile Database.[2] The study of the traditional reptile orders,
        customarily in combination with the study of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.

        Reptiles have been subject to several conflicting taxonomic definitions.[3] In Linnaean taxonomy, reptiles are
        gathered together under the class Reptilia (/rɛpˈtɪliə/ rep-TIL-ee-ə), which corresponds to common usage. Modern
        cladistic taxonomy regards that group as paraphyletic, since genetic and paleontological evidence has determined
        that birds (class Aves), as members of Dinosauria, are more closely related to living crocodilians than to other
        reptiles, and are thus nested among reptiles from an evolutionary perspective. Many cladistic systems therefore
        redefine Reptilia as a clade (monophyletic group) including birds, though the precise definition of this clade
        varies between authors.[4][3] Others prioritize the clade Sauropsida, which typically refers to all amniotes
        more closely related to modern reptiles than to mammals.[4]

        The earliest known proto-reptiles originated from the Carboniferous period, having evolved from advanced
        reptiliomorph tetrapods which became increasingly adapted to life on dry land. The earliest known eureptile
        ("true reptile") was Hylonomus, a small and superficially lizard-like animal which lived in Nova Scotia during
        the Bashkirian age of the Late Carboniferous, around 318 million years ago.[1] Genetic and fossil data argues
        that the two largest lineages of reptiles, Archosauromorpha (crocodilians, birds, and kin) and Lepidosauromorpha
        (lizards, and kin), diverged during the Permian period.[5] In addition to the living reptiles, there are many
        diverse groups that are now extinct, in some cases due to mass extinction events. In particular, the
        Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event wiped out the pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, and all non-avian dinosaurs
        alongside many species of crocodyliforms and squamates (e.g., mosasaurs). Modern non-bird reptiles inhabit all
        the continents except Antarctica.

        Reptiles are tetrapod vertebrates, creatures that either have four limbs or, like snakes, are descended from
        four-limbed ancestors. Unlike amphibians, reptiles do not have an aquatic larval stage. Most reptiles are
        oviparous, although several species of squamates are viviparous, as were some extinct aquatic clades[6]  – the
        fetus develops within the mother, using a (non-mammalian) placenta rather than contained in an eggshell. As
        amniotes, reptile eggs are surrounded by membranes for protection and transport, which adapt them to
        reproduction on dry land. Many of the viviparous species feed their fetuses through various forms of placenta
        analogous to those of mammals, with some providing initial care for their hatchlings. Extant reptiles range in
        size from a tiny gecko, Sphaerodactylus ariasae, which can grow up to 17 mm (0.7 in) to the saltwater crocodile,
        Crocodylus porosus, which can reach over 6 m (19.7 ft) in length and weigh over 1,000 kg (2,200 lb).</p>
