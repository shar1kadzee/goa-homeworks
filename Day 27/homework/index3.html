    <p class="p-1">Li Lianjie (courtesy name Yangzhong; born 26 April 1963),[2] better known by his stage name Jet Li, is a
        Chinese-born Singaporean martial artist, actor, and philanthropist. After three years of training with acclaimed
        wushu teacher Wu Bin, Li won his first national championship for the Beijing Wushu Team at age 11. Between 1974
        and 1979, he won the title of Men's All-Around National Wushu Champion five times.[3] After retiring from
        competitive wushu at age 18, he went on to win great acclaim as an actor, making his debut with the Chinese-Hong
        Kong martial arts film Shaolin Temple (1982), which instantly catapulted him to stardom in East Asia.[4]

        Though continued success followed after two sequels in 1984 and 1986, Li had a major breakthrough across Asia
        with the Once Upon a Time in China film series (1991â€“1993), in which he portrayed Chinese folk hero Wong
        Fei-hung. He continued to appear in Hong Kong films set in old China, such as Swordsman II (1992), Tai Chi
        Master, Fong Sai-yuk, Fong Sai-yuk II, Kung Fu Cult Master, Last Hero in China (all 1993), and The New Legend of
        Shaolin (1994). He starred in his directorial debut film Born to Defence (1986), which saw Li, for the first
        time, playing a character in a period setting.[5] In the 1990s, he appeared in several contemporary action films
        which fused guns and kung fu, most notably High Risk (1995), Black Mask (1996), and Hitman (1998).[6] He
        portrayed Chen Zhen in the critically acclaimed film Fist of Legend (1994). His movie career in China is
        credited with reviving wushu in Hong Kong martial arts films during the 1990s,[3] and revitalising the Shaolin
        Temple.[7] Li is also noted for his contribution to making new wuxia films popular internationally during his
        career.[4]</p>
