    <p class="p-1">Jean-Claude Camille François Van Varenberg (French: [ʒɑ̃ klod kamij fʁɑ̃swa vɑ̃ vaʁɑ̃bɛʁɡ], Flemish: [vɑɱ
        ˈvaːrə(m)bɛr(ə)x]; born 18 October 1960), known professionally as Jean-Claude Van Damme (French: [vɑ̃ dam],
        Flemish: [vɑn ˈdɑmə]), is a Belgian martial artist and actor. Born and raised in Brussels, his father enrolled
        him in a Shotokan karate school at the age of ten, which led Van Damme to hold the rank of 2nd-dan black belt in
        karate, and compete in several karate and kickboxing competitions. As a teenager, he won the middleweight
        championship of the European Professional Karate Association in 1979 and the Mr. Belgium bodybuilding title in
        1978. With the desire of becoming an actor in Hollywood, he moved to the United States in 1982, where he worked
        on several films, until he got his break as the lead in the martial arts film Bloodsport (1988).</p>
    <p class="p-2">He became a popular action film star and followed up with commercially successful films such as Cyborg, Kickboxer
        (both 1989), Lionheart, Death Warrant (both 1990), Double Impact (1991), Universal Soldier (1992), Nowhere to
        Run, Hard Target (both 1993), Timecop, Street Fighter (both 1994), Sudden Death (1995), The Quest, which marked
        his directorial debut, and Maximum Risk (both 1996). He achieved sex symbol status in the late 1980s and early
        1990s. Between 1993 and 1998, three Hong Kong filmmakers collaborated with Van Damme for their debuts in Western
        cinema: John Woo, Tsui Hark, and Ringo Lam.[1] After a decline in popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s,
        he returned to prominence with the critically acclaimed crime drama JCVD (2008). His big return to the action
        genre was in The Expendables 2 (2012), in which he starred as the villain, opposite Sylvester Stallone's
        character.</p>
