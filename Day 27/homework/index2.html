        <p class="p-1">Fang Shilong[a] SBS MBE PMW[3] (born Chan Kong-sang[b]; 7 April 1954), known professionally as Jackie
            Chan,[c] is a Hong Kong actor, director, writer, producer, martial artist, and stuntman known for his
            slapstick - acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, and innovative stunts, which he typically performs
            himself. Before entering the film industry, he was one of the Seven Little Fortunes from the China Drama
            Academy at the Peking Opera School, where he studied acrobatics, martial arts, and acting. In a film career
            spanning more than sixty years, he has appeared in over 150 domestic and international movies. Chan is
            regarded as one of the most iconic and influential martial artists in the history of cinema.[4][5]

            After appearing in many Hong Kong films as a stuntman, Chan's first major breakthrough was the 1978 kung fu
            action comedy film Snake in the Eagle's Shadow. He then starred in similar kung fu action comedy films such
            as 1978's Drunken Master and 1980's The Young Master. In 1979, he made his directorial debut with The
            Fearless Hyena, which was a box office success. Throughout the 1980s, he was part of the "Three Dragons"
            along with Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao; the three starred in six Hong Kong films together.[6] 1983's Project A
            saw the official formation of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team and established Chan's signature style of
            elaborate, dangerous stunts combined with martial arts and slapstick humor, a style he further developed in
            a more modern setting with 1984's Wheels on Meals and 1985's Police Story. Rumble in the Bronx (1995), which
            had a successful worldwide theatrical run, brought Chan into the North American mainstream.[7][8] He gained
            international fame for portraying Chief Inspector Lee in the American buddy cop action comedy film Rush Hour
            (1998), a role he reprised in two sequels.</p>
