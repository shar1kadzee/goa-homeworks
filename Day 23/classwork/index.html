                <h1>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</h1>
                <p>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is a 2007 American epic fantasy swashbuckler film directed
                    by
                    Gore Verbinski, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and written by the writing team of Ted Elliott and
                    Terry
                    Rossio. The direct sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006), it is the third
                    installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. Set a few months after Dead Man's Chest,
                    the
                    story follows an urgent quest to locate and rescue Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), trapped on a
                    sea
                    of sand in Davy Jones' Locker, and convene the Brethren Court in a war against the East India
                    Trading
                    Company. In an uneasy alliance, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley),
                    Hector
                    Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), and the crew of the Black Pearl rescue Jack and prepare to fight Lord
                    Cutler
                    Beckett, who controls Davy Jones and the Flying Dutchman.</p>

                <p>Two sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl were conceived in 2004, with
                    Elliott and Rossio developing a story arc that would span both films. The film was shot in two
                    shoots during 2005 and 2006, the former of which was released as Dead Man's Chest. This also marks
                    the final film of the series to be directed by Verbinski. With a production budget of nearly US$300
                    million, it was, at time of production, the most expensive film ever made.</p>
