        <p>Apple Inc. is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered and incorporated in
            Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley. It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and
            services. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the
            company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed
            Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is
            the largest technology company by revenue, with US$383.29 billion in 2023.

            The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the
            Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa
            in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a
            mouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrawing to
            other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost
            considerable market share in the personal computer industry to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the
            Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones. In 1997, Apple was weeks away from
            bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy, it bought NeXT, effectively bringing Jobs back
            to the company, who guided Apple back to profitability over the next decade with the introductions of the
            iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad devices to critical acclaim as well as the iTunes Store, launching the "Think
            different" advertising campaign, and opening the Apple Store retail chain. These moves elevated Apple to
            consistently be one of the world's most valuable brands since about 2010. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health
            reasons, and died two months later; he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.</p>

    <p>pple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a
        partnership.[9][12] The company's first product is the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by
        Wozniak.[13] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65
        calculator.[14]: 57  Neither received the full selling price but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $7,000 in
        2023). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[15] The Apple I
        was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which was not yet
        marketed as a complete personal computer.[16] It was priced soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,600
        in 2023).[17][18]: 180  Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number
        666, and that he came up with the price because he liked "repeating digits".[19]

        Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated in Cupertino, California,[1] on January 3, 1977,[20][21] without Wayne,
        who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having
        co-founded it.[22] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000
        (equivalent to $1,257,000 in 2023) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[23] During the first
        five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977
        and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to US$118 million, an average annual growth rate of
        533%.[24]

        The Apple II, also designed by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer
        Faire.[25] It differs from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based
        color graphics and open architecture. The Apple I and early Apple II models use ordinary audio cassette tapes as
        storage devices, which were superseded by the 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in
        1978.[26][27]

        The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first killer application of the business world:
        VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979.[26] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and
        gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office,[26] but Apple II market
        share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari, Commodore, and Tandy.[28][29]

        On December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol "AAPL") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10
        per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September 3, 2022),[21] generating over $100 million, which was
        more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[30] By the end of the day, around 300 millionaires
        were created, including Jobs and Wozniak, from a stock price of $29 per share[31] and a market cap of $1.778
        billion.[30][31]</p>
