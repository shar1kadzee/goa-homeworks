    <p>Samsung Group[3] (Korean: 삼성; Hanja: 三星; RR: samseong [samsʌŋ]; stylised as SΛMSUNG) is a South Korean
        multinational manufacturing conglomerate headquartered in Samsung Digital City, Suwon, South Korea.[1] It
        comprises numerous affiliated businesses,[1] most of them united under the Samsung brand, and is the largest
        South Korean chaebol (business conglomerate). As of 2024, Samsung has the world's fifth-highest brand value.[4]

        Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chul in 1938 as a trading company. Over the next three decades, the group
        diversified into areas including food processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail. Samsung entered
        the electronics industry in the late 1960s and the construction and shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s;
        these areas would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987, Samsung was separated into five
        business groups – Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group, Hansol Group, and JoongAng Group.

        Samsung industrial affiliates include Samsung Electronics, Samsung Heavy Industries, Samsung Engineering and
        Samsung C&T Corporation. Other subsidiaries include Samsung Life Insurance and Cheil Worldwide. Notable Samsung
        industrial affiliates include Samsung Electronics (the world's largest information technology company, consumer
        electronics maker and chipmaker measured by 2017 revenues),[5][6] Samsung Heavy Industries (the world's second
        largest shipbuilder measured by 2010 revenues),[7] and Samsung Engineering and Samsung C&T Corporation
        (respectively the world's 13th and 36th largest construction companies).[8] Other notable subsidiaries include
        Samsung Life Insurance (the world's 14th largest life insurance company),[9] Samsung Everland (operator of
        Everland Resort, the oldest theme park in South Korea)[10] and Cheil Worldwide (the world's 15th largest
        advertising agency, as measured by 2012 revenues).[11][12]</p>

    <p>In 1938, during Japanese-ruled Korea, Lee Byung-chul (1910–1987) of a large landowning family in the Uiryeong
        county moved to nearby Daegu city and founded Mitsuboshi Trading Company (株式会社三星商会 (Kabushiki gaisha Mitsuboshi
        Shōkai)), or Samsung Sanghoe (주식회사 삼성상회). Samsung started out as a small trading company with forty employees
        located in Su-dong (now Ingyo-dong).[16] It dealt in dried fish,[16] locally-grown groceries and noodles.[17]
        The company prospered and Lee moved its head office to Seoul in 1947. When the Korean War broke out, he was
        forced to leave Seoul. He started a sugar refinery in Busan named Cheil Jedang. In 1954, Lee founded Cheil
        Mojik, a textiles company, and built the first plant in Chimsan-dong, Daegu. It was the largest woollen mill in
        the country at the time of construction.[18]

        Samsung diversified into many different areas. Lee sought to establish Samsung as a leader in a wide range of
        industries. Samsung moved into lines of business such as insurance, securities, and retail.

        In 1947, Cho Hong-jai, the Hyosung group's founder, jointly invested in a new company called Samsung Mulsan
        Gongsa, or the Samsung Trading Corporation, with the Samsung's founder Lee Byung-chul. The trading firm grew to
        become the present-day Samsung C&T Corporation. After a few years, Cho and Lee separated due to differences in
        management style. Cho wanted a 30 equity share. Samsung Group was separated into Samsung Group and Hyosung
        Group, Hankook Tire and other businesses.[19][20]

        In the late 1960s, Samsung Group entered the electronics industry. It formed several electronics-related
        divisions, such as Samsung Electronics Devices, Samsung Electro-Mechanics, Samsung Corning and Samsung
        Semiconductor & Telecommunications, and opened the facility in Suwon. Its first product was a black-and-white
        television set.[21] Byung-chul was also the owner of the Tongyang Broadcasting Company, a private radio and
        television company that existed from 1964 to 1980, shut down after the Korean government reviewed the number of
        media outlets allowed.[22] TBC allowed an early success thanks to its connections to Samsung, boosting the sale
        of its television sets.[23]</p>
