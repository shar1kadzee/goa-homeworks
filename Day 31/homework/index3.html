        <p>Steven Allan Spielberg (/ˈspiːlbɜːrɡ/; born December 18, 1946) is an American filmmaker. A major figure of
            the
            New Hollywood era and pioneer of the modern blockbuster, Spielberg is widely regarded as one of the greatest
            film directors of all time and is the most commercially successful director in film history.[1] Among other
            accolades, he has received three Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards as well as
            the
            AFI Life Achievement Award in 1995, the Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire
            in
            2001, the Kennedy Center Honor in 2006, the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2009 and the Presidential Medal of
            Freedom
            in 2015. Seven of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as
            "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant".[2][3]

            Spielberg was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and grew up in Phoenix, Arizona.[4] He moved to California and
            studied
            film in college. After directing several episodes for television, including Night Gallery and Columbo, he
            directed the television film Duel (1971), his first full-length film which later received an international
            theatrical release. He made his theatrical debut with The Sugarland Express (1974) and became a household
            name
            with the summer blockbuster Jaws (1975). He directed more escapist box office successes with Close
            Encounters of
            the Third Kind (1977), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and the original Indiana Jones trilogy (1981–89).
            He
            explored drama in The Color Purple (1985) and Empire of the Sun (1987).</p>
