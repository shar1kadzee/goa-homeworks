        <p> Quentin Jerome Tarantino (/ˌtærənˈtiːnoʊ/; born March 27, 1963) is an American filmmaker, actor,
            and
            author. His
            films are characterized by stylized violence, extended dialogue often featuring much profanity, and
            references
            to popular culture. His work has earned a cult following alongside critical and commercial success; he has
            been
            named by some as the single most influential director of his generation and has received numerous awards and
            nominations, including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards.

            Tarantino began his career with the independent crime drama film Reservoir Dogs (1992). His second film, the
            crime drama Pulp Fiction (1994), was a major success and won numerous awards, including the Cannes Film
            Festival's Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He next wrote and starred in the
            action horror film From Dusk till Dawn (1996). His third film as director, the crime drama Jackie Brown
            (1997),
            paid homage to blaxploitation films.

            Tarantino wrote and directed the martial arts films Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003) and Kill Bill: Volume 2
            (2004),
            with both volumes combined regarded as a single film. He then made the exploitation-slasher film Death Proof
            (2007), which was part of a double feature with From Dusk till Dawn director Robert Rodriguez, released
            under
            the collective title Grindhouse. His next film, Inglourious Basterds (2009), followed an alternate account
            of
            World War II. He followed this with Django Unchained (2012), a slave revenge Spaghetti Western which won him
            his
            second Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. His eighth film, The Hateful Eight (2015), was a
            revisionist
            Western thriller and opened to audiences with a roadshow release.

            Tarantino's most recent film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), was a comedy-drama set in the late 1960s
            about the transition of Old Hollywood to New Hollywood; his debut novel, a novelization of the film, was
            published in 2021. He has said that, though it is not definite, his current plan is for his next film to be
            his
            last before he retires.</p>
